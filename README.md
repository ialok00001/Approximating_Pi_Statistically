# Approximating_Pi_Statistically

As a part of my ongoing project on Simulation Techniques, I have attempted to approximate the constant Pi, using the fact that the probability that a randomly chosen point in a square will be inside the inscribed circle with a probability of $\pi/4$, and also the central limit theorem. Here, I have attempted the approximation in 2D, 3D, and 4D and have compared their convergence by plotting them on the same graph.
